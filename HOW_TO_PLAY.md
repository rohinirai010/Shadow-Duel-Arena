## 💡 Strategy & Tips

### Energy Management
- ⚡ Energy does NOT regenerate automatically
- 🎯 Save energy for powerful abilities at the right time
- ⚠️ Don't waste energy on weak attacks when enemy is low HP
- 🔄 Use REST ability to gain energy (+15⚡ but costs -5❤️)

### Defensive Play
- 🛡️ Use Defend when enemy has high energy (likely to use Fireball/strong attacks)
- 💊 Heal early, not when critically low (waste if you die next turn)
- 🧠 Anticipate opponent patterns

### Offensive Play
- 🔥 Fireball for burst damage (35 vs 20 from basic attack)
- ⚔️ Chain abilities - use basic attack to set up for Fireball
- 🎲 Mix it up - predictable patterns get countered

### Character-Specific Tips

**Mage:** Use high damage abilities, but watch HP closely (only 80 HP)
**Knight:** Balanced, can take hits and deal damage
**Ranger:** Fast, use speed to pressure opponents
**Assassin:** High damage but fragile - kill fast or die
**Tank:** Outlast opponents, use HP advantage
**Healer:** Sustain and whittle down enemies
